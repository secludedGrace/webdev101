##### No, you cannot use the same _id_ attribute on more than one element in an **HTML** document. This is because of the fact that we use _id_ attributes as targets for links since one attribute cannot refer to more than one link within the same **HTML** document. On the other hand, you can use the same _class_ on multiple elements in a document. This can be helpful for styling since the same styles can be reused and if needed can be overriden with a new class to make further modifications.
